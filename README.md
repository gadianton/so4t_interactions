# Stack Overflow for Teams Interactions (so4t_interactions)
An API script for Stack Overflow for Teams that creates a chord diagram, demonstrating how teams are interacting within the product.

Example chord diagram:

![Example chord diagram](https://github.com/jklick-so/so4t_interactions/blob/main/Examples/chord_diagram.png)


## Requirements
* Python 3.9 or higher ([download](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
* Operating system: Linux, MacOS, or Windows
* "Department" assertion enabled in SAML configuration (admin settings)


## Setup

[Download](https://github.com/jklick-so/so4t_interactions/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and unpack the contents of this repository

**Installing Dependencies**

* Open a terminal window (or, for Windows, a command prompt)
* Navigate to the directory where you unpacked the files
* Install the dependencies: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

**API Authentication**
For the Basic and Business tiers, you'll need an API token. For Enterprise, you'll need to obtain both an API key and an API token.

* For Basic or Business, instructions for creating a personal access token (PAT) can be found in [this KB article](https://stackoverflow.help/en/articles/4385859-stack-overflow-for-teams-api).
* For Enteprise, documentation for creating the key and token can be found within your instance, at this url: `https://[your_site]/api/docs/authentication`

Creating an access token for Enterpise can sometimes be tricky for people who haven't done it before. Here are some (hopefully) straightforward instructions:
* Go to the page where you created your API key. Take note of the "Client ID" associated with your API key.
* Go to the following URL, replacing the base URL, the `client_id`, and base URL of the `redirect_uri` with your own:
`https://YOUR.SO-ENTERPRISE.URL/oauth/dialog?client_id=111&redirect_uri=https://YOUR.SO-ENTERPRISE.URL/oauth/login_success`
* You may be prompted to login to Stack Overflow Enterprise, if you're not already. Either way, you'll be redirected to a page that simply says "Authorizing Application"
* In the URL of that page, you'll find your access token. Example: `https://YOUR.SO-ENTERPRISE.URL/oauth/login_success#access_token=YOUR_TOKEN`


## Basic Usage
In a terminal window, navigate to the directory where you unpacked the script. 
Run the script using the following format, replacing the URL, token, and/or key with your own:
- Business: `python3 so4t_interactions.py --url "https://stackoverflowteams.com/c/TEAM-NAME" --token "YOUR_TOKEN"`
- Enterprise: `python3 so4t_interactions.py --url "https://SUBDOMAIN.stackenterprise.co" --key "YOUR_KEY"`

At the beginning of the script, a small Chrome window will appear, prompting you to login to your instance of Stack Overflow Enterpise. This is necessary in order to obtain data that is not currently available via the API.

After logging in, the Chrome window will disappear and the script will proceed in the terminal window. Creating a login session necessary in order to gather additional data from Stack Overflow for Teams that is not available via the API.

The script can take several minutes to run. As it runs, it will continue to update the terminal window with the tasks it's performing.

When the script completes, it will indicate the chord diagram has been created, and will provide the path to the file. The file will be saved in the same directory as the script.


## Advanced Usage

There are some additional arguments you can add to the command line to customize the script's behavior, which are described below. All arguments (and instructions) can also be found by running the `--help` argument: `python3 so4t_interactions.py --help`

### `--remove-team-numbers`

In many organizations, team names aren't as simple as "Engineering" or "Product Management". Instead, they're often something like "Eng1" or "PM2.6". This can be problematic when it creates too much granularity for the chord diagram. 

The `--remove-team-numbers` argument allows you to easily remove the team number from the team names. Example: "Eng1" and "Eng2.1" would both be renamed to simply "Eng", thus consolidating the two teams into one for the chord diagram.

Example usage:
`python3 so4t_interactions.py --url "https://SUBDOMAIN.stackenterprise.co" --key "YOUR_KEY" --remove-team-numbers`

> NOTE: this argument does not have compatibility with the `--team-rename` argument. Choose one or the other.

### `--team-rename`

This is a more powerful method of changing team names. Sometimes the team names obtained from the identity provider (via SAML) aren't ideal for a variety of reasons. Examples:
* Too verbose: "PMO - Project Management Office - CIO Special Projects"
* Too generic: "Team 1"
* Too specific: "Team 1 - Argentina"

Also, there's often a desire to consolidate team names that are functionally the same, but have different names in the identity provider. Example: "Team 1 - Argentina" and "Team 1 - London" could be renamed to simply "Team 1".

The `--team-rename` argument allows you to provide a CSV file ([template here](https://github.com/jklick-so/so4t_interactions/tree/main/Templates)) that maps the team names from the identity provider to a more appropriate name. The CSV file should have two columns:
* `old_team_name` - the name of the team as it appears in the identity provider
* `new_team_name` - the name you'd like to use in the chord diagram

Example usage:
`python3 so4t_interactions.py --url "https://SUBDOMAIN.stackenterprise.co" --key "YOUR_KEY" --team-rename "PATH_TO_CSV"`

> NOTE: this argument does not have compatibility with the `--remove-team-number` argument. Choose one or the other.
